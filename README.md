## About The Project
While SNK never officially released any BIOS source for the Neo Geo platform, this project aims to provide a clean, open-source re-implementation of the Neo Geo BIOS to preserve legacy functionality and enable ongoing development. Although earlier community ports and patches delivered tremendous value, many stalled or never reached full maturity. Hopefully, this project can revamp interest and continue the journey.

Project goals:
* Open source release: Make the full BIOS code freely available under a permissive license.
* High-level implementation: Rewrite in C (instead of raw assembly) for readability, maintainability, and ease of contribution.
* Improved functionality: featuring new menus, cheat codes, and more.

Core technologies:
* Language: C
* Build system: CMake
* Compiler: GCC

By choosing these tools and languages, the project can ensure the BIOS codebase remains accessible to as many developers as possible.

Contributions and feedback are very welcome!

## Getting Started
_While development and testing are primarily conducted on Ubuntu with Visual Studio Code and MAME, the codebase is designed for maximum cross-platform compatibility_
### Prerequisites
```sh
apt-get install cmake gcc-m68k-linux-gnu
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Build the ROM-file
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DSYSTEM=MVS -DREGION=EUROPE
   cmake --build .
   ```
3. Burn the ROM to a MC27C1024

### Develope

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Copy following files into the `assets` folder (you need to provide these yourself)
    ```sh
    000-lo.lo
    sfix.sfix
    sm1.sm1
    ```
3. Build the ROM-file
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DSYSTEM=MVS -DREGION=EUROPE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
   cmake --build .
   ```
4. Test the rom with MAME
    ```sh
    mame neogeo -rompath ./ -skip_gameinfo -verbose -debug [gamename]
    ```

## Game compability
Development has mainly focused on games that differ from one another in their features and BIOS usage. Hopefully, this list will grow more and more quickly as development progresses.

| Game       | Console | Status          |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Metal slug | MV1FZS  | Boot, > stage 1 |
| NAM 1975   | MV1FZS  | Boot, > stage 1 |
